1. Functions are often used to validate input. Write a function that accepts a single
integer as a parameter and returns True if the integer is in the range 0 to 100
(inclusive), or False otherwise. Write a short program to test the function.
2. Write a function that has a single string as its parameter, and returns the number of
uppercase letters, and the number of lowercase letters in the string. Test the
function with a short program.
3. Modify your "greetings" program so that the first letter of the name entered is
always in uppercase with the rest in lowercase. This should happen even if the user
entered their name differently. So if the user entered arthur, ARTHUR, or even
arTHur the name should be displayed as Arthur.
4. When processing data it is often useful to remove the last character from some
input (it is often a newline). Write and test a function that takes a string parameter
and returns it with the last character removed. (If the string contains one or fewer
characters, return it unchanged.)
5. Write and test a function that converts a temperature measured in degrees
centigrade into the equivalent in fahrenheit, and another that does the reverse
conversion. Test both functions. (Google will find you the formulae).
6. Write a program that takes a centigrade temperature and displays the equivalent in
fahrenheit. The input should be a number followed by a letter C. The output should
be in the same format.
7. Write a program that reads 6 temperatures (in the same format as before), and
displays the maximum, minimum, and mean of the values.
Hint: You should know there are built-in functions for max and min. If you hunt, you
might also find one for the mean.
8. Modify the previous program so that it can process any number of values. The input
terminates when the user just pressed "Enter" at the prompt rather than entering a
value.
